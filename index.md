## Welcome
This lesson is about the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python, with applications in the Humanities and Social Sciences.

It will equip you with the foundational skills and knowledge needed to carry over text-based research projects. The lesson is designed specifically with researchers in the humanities and social sciences in mind, but is also applicable to other fields of research.

### What is NLP?
Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of research and application that focuses on making natural (i.e., human) language accessible to computers so that they can be used to perform useful tasks. Research in NLP is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on concepts from computer science, linguistics, logic, mathematics, psychology, etc. In the past decade, NLP has evolved significantly with advances in technology, especially in the field of deep learning, to the point that it has become embedded in our daily lives: automatic language translation or chatGPT are only some examples.
