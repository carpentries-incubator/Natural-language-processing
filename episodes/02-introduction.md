## Introducing NLP

### What is NLP?
Natural language processing (NLP) aims to develop methods for solving practical problems involving language.
In literature, it is common to see a crossover with the field of Computational Linguistics (CL), whereby the focus
is on employing computational methods to understand properties of human language. In recent years, the field of NLP
has undergone a dramatic shift, both in terms of methodology and of the applications supported thanks to the advances
in computer hardware. This made possible several other crossovers with a number of related fields, among which: Computer science,
artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, psycholinguistics, neuroscience and many others.

### Why do we care?
The past decade's breakthroughs have resulted in NLP being increasingly used in a range of diverse domains such as retail,
healthcare, finance, law, marketing and many more. At the same time, an increased interest in Digital Humanities and Social
Sciences textual datasets within the NLP community has prompted the development of computational techniques to analyse and model
humanities and social sciences data. To date, a number of successful results have been achieved, in the area of handwriting recognition [cit],
computational stylistics [cit], historical corpora [cit], semantic change detection [cit] and sentiment analysis [in social media, cit, in politics, cit], to name a few examples.

With so many contributions and such impressive advances of recent years, it is an exciting time to start bringing NLP techniques
in our own work.
