## Introducing NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) aims to develop methods for solving practical problems involving language.
In literature, it is common to see a crossover with the field of Computational Linguistics (CL), whereby the focus
is on employing computational methods to understand properties of human language. In recent years, the field of NLP
has undergone a dramatic shift, both in terms of methodology and of the applications supported. Methodological advances
have made possible the crossover with another field, that is, Machine Learning.
