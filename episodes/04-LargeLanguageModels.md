## What are Large Language Models?
Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, designed to process and interpret large-scale natural language data to generate responses to user queries. By being trained on extensive datasets through advanced machine learning algorithms, these models learn the intricate patterns, structures and nuances of human language. This enables them to produce coherent and natural-sounding language outputs across various written inputs. As a result, large language models are becoming increasingly essential in a range of applications, such as natural language processing, machine translation, and the generation of text and code, among others. 

The emergence of *ChatGPT*, powered by OpenAI's advanced LLMs, has brought these capabilities into the mainstream. With ChatGPT, users interact through natural language, enabling seamless conversations and performing complex tasks across various sectors, like customer service, education, and content creation. Models like GPT-4, BERT, and LLaMA are also used across various applications; from chatbots, virtual assistants, text analysis, translation, summarization, and more.

Notably, the success of ChatGPT and other LLM-driven applications highlights their versatility and potential to transform how we interact with digital systems. These models continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in human-computer interaction, offering a glimpse into a future where machines and humans communicate more naturally and effectively.

### Timeline
The journey of large language models over the past decade highlights the rapid evolution and growing impact of AI in language processing:

- **2012**: Significant advancements in deep learning architectures and access to larger datasets lead to the creation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) framework, marking a pivotal point in AI development.

- **2018**: Google unveils BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introducing a groundbreaking architecture that sets the stage for the next generation of large language models.

- **2020**: OpenAI releases GPT-3, which, with its remarkable 175 billion parameters, establishes a new standard for performance in language-related tasks.

- **2022**: The launch of ChatGPT marks a turning point by making GPT-3 and similar models easily accessible to the public via a web interface, significantly raising public awareness and interest in LLMs and generative AI.

- **2023**: Open-source LLMs begin to deliver impressive outcomes with the introduction of models like Dolly 2.0, LLaMA, Alpaca, and Vicuna. Meanwhile, the release of GPT-4 pushes the envelope by setting new records for both parameter scale and overall performance.

### Starting up a simple chat 
Let's explore how these LLMs work by doing a simple chat demonstration.

Imagine asking a computer a question and getting a human-like response. An LLM, like GPT-4, can generate responses that feel natural, informative, and tailored to your question by analyzing the context and meaning of your input. In the demonstration below, you'll see how an LLM responds to a prompt and how it builds upon previous information to maintain the conversation.

### Example Chat

- *User*: "What's the tallest mountain in the world?"

- *LLM*: "The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest, which stands at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet)."

- *User*: "How long does it take to climb it?"

- *LLM*: "Climbing Mount Everest typically takes around two months, due to the acclimatization process needed to adjust to high altitudes. Expeditions often start from Base Camp in Nepal, where climbers spend several weeks preparing."

- *User*: "Could someone with no climbing experience try it?"

- *LLM*: "Climbing Mount Everest is extremely challenging and requires significant training and experience due to the harsh conditions, high altitudes, and technical aspects of the climb. Most climbers spend years training and gaining experience on other mountains before attempting Everest."

This example shows how LLMs can maintain context across multiple questions. Notice how the model connects information across each question, keeping the conversation relevant and informed.

### Challenge 1: Try chatting yourself with an LLM
If you’d like to try this yourself, here’s a small exercise:

- Open an LLM interface (such as ChatGPT or a similar service).
- Think of a question on a topic you’re interested in, like a famous historical event, a scientific question, or even advice on writing.
- Notice how the model responds to your follow-up questions, using previous context to build its responses.

This quick chat example introduces you to the conversational abilities of LLMs, demonstrating their ability to respond contextually, provide coherent answers, and follow up on earlier parts of the conversation.

## How are LLMs different from other NLP techniques?
LLMs stand apart from traditional NLP techniques due to their scale, versatility, and reliance on deep learning models, especially Transformers. Here’s a breakdown of how they differ:

### Scale of training data and parameters
- LLMs: Trained on massive datasets (trillions of words) and use billions of parameters, allowing them to learn language patterns, facts, and relationships at an unprecedented depth.
- Traditional NLP: Techniques like rule-based systems or smaller machine learning models rely on much smaller datasets, often requiring domain-specific training for each task (e.g., sentiment analysis or named entity recognition).

### Model architecture
- LLMs: Use the Transformer architecture, particularly self-attention, to analyze relationships between words regardless of position. This allows them to capture long-range dependencies and context better than traditional models.
- Traditional NLP: Often use simpler models like bag-of-words, TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), or shallow neural networks, which treat words independently or consider only local context, missing the complex, global relationships.

### Generalization vs. task-specific models
- LLMs: Can be applied across a wide range of tasks—summarization, translation, question answering, etc.—without the need for separate models for each. Fine-tuning makes them even more adaptable to specific needs.
- Traditional NLP: Typically requires developing or training a separate model for each task. For example, separate models for sentiment analysis, translation, and entity recognition.

### Learning from unlabeled data
- LLMs: Leverage unsupervised or self-supervised learning during pretraining, enabling them to learn language patterns from raw text without human-labeled data.
- Traditional NLP: Often relies on labeled data for training (e.g., labeled sentiment or part-of-speech tags), which can be costly and time-consuming to create at scale.

### Context and language nuance
- LLMs: Excel at understanding context, tone, and nuance, due to their ability to weigh word relationships dynamically. This enables better handling of idioms, sarcasm, and ambiguous phrases.
- Traditional NLP: Struggles with complex language nuances, often producing more rigid or literal interpretations. Contextual understanding is limited, especially for longer sentences or paragraphs.

### Adaptability and fine-tuning
- LLMs: Easily adaptable to new tasks or domains with fine-tuning, making them versatile across different applications.
- Traditional NLP: Less flexible, often requiring retraining from scratch or heavy feature engineering to adapt to new domains or tasks.

In short, LLMs represent a leap forward by combining scale, flexibility, and deep learning power, allowing for more accurate, nuanced, and versatile language processing compared to traditional NLP techniques.

## What LLMs are good at
- *Language generation*: Creating coherent and contextually appropriate text, making them ideal for creative writing, chatbots, and automated responses.
- *Summarization and translation*: Quickly summarizing articles, books, and translating text between languages with reasonable accuracy.
- *Information retrieval and answering questions*: LLMs can recall and apply general knowledge from their training data to answer questions, though they don’t actually “know” facts.
- *Sentiment and text classification*: LLMs can classify text for tasks like sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization.

## What LLMs struggle with
- *Fact-based accuracy*: Since LLMs don’t “know” facts, they may generate incorrect or outdated information and are prone to hallucinations (making up facts).
- *Understanding context over long passages*: LLMs can struggle with context over very long texts and may lose track of earlier details, affecting coherence.
- *Mathematical reasoning and logic*: Though improving, LLMs often find complex problem-solving and detailed logical reasoning challenging without direct guidance.
- *Ethical and sensitive issues*: LLMs may produce biased or offensive text based on biases present in the training data, making content moderation necessary in sensitive applications.

## How do LLMs work?
So, how is it that you can chat with a model and receive responses that seem almost human? The answer lies in the architecture and training of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are powered by advanced neural networks that understand, generate, and even translate human language with surprising accuracy.

At the core of LLMs lies a framework known as the **transformer**; a concept we already encountered in the previous episode. Transformers allow these models to process vast amounts of text and learn the structure and nuances of language. This setup enables LLMs not only to answer questions but also to predict, complete, and even generate coherent text based on the patterns they've learned.

LLMs are trained on large text datasets and later fine-tuned on specific tasks, which helps them adapt to a wide range of applications, from conversation to text classification. The result? A model that can chat, summarize, translate, and much more—all by leveraging these core mechanisms. LLM's rely on the following key concepts:

- **Transformers and self-attention**: The transformer architecture, especially the self-attention mechanism, is at the heart of LLMs. Self-attention enables these models to understand the importance of each word in relation to others in a sequence, regardless of their position.
- **Pretraining and fine-tuning**: LLMs are first pre-trained on large text datasets using tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence, learning language patterns. They are then fine-tuned on specific tasks (e.g., translation, summarization) to enhance performance for targeted applications.
- **Generative vs. discriminative models**: LMs can be applied to both generative tasks (e.g., text generation) and discriminative tasks (e.g., classification).

Below is a simplified diagram of the transformer architecture, which highlights the role of self-attention in understanding relationships between words:

[#TODO: ADD A NICE FIGURE. CAN WE USE AN EXISITNG IMAGE FROM SOMEWHERE]

Let’s see how this actually works with a hands-on example. We’ll use Hugging Face’s library to load a pretrained model and visualize the self-attention scores for a sentence.

### How self-attention enables language models to generate responses

In practice, this attention mechanism helps LLMs produce coherent responses by establishing relationships between words as each new token is generated. Here’s how it works: 

- *Understanding word relationships*. Self-attention enables the model to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence, no matter where it appears, to make sense of the sentence as a whole.

- *Predicting next words based on context*. With these relationships mapped out, the model can predict the next word in a sequence. For example, in “The fox,” self-attention allows the model to anticipate that “jumps” or “runs” might come next rather than something unrelated like “table.”

- *Structuring responses*. As each word is generated, the model assesses how each new token impacts the entire sentence, ensuring that responses are relevant, logically sound, and grammatically correct. This ability to “structure” language is why LLMs can produce responses that are contextually meaningful and well-organized.
  
By leveraging self-attention to build meaningful relationships across tokens, transformers power LLMs to generate responses that feel relevant, accurate, and human-like.

## A zoo of Large Language Models
The era of Large Language Models started with the release of the model called BERT, created by Google, that was discussed in the previous episode. The techniques used in that model started a movement of the creating of many new models. There are a number of big companies that keep improving on their models and releasing new ones rapidly. The most famous one that we all probably heard of is GPT, the model developed by OpenAI and that is used for ChatGPT. The first version of GPT was released in 2018. Since then various versions have been released, each improved in performance by using more parameters and a larger training data set.  While the first GPT model was open source, the recent versions are not. This means that the model architecture, number of parameters, and used training data is undisclosed. There are however many more competing models, some of which are more transparent of even fully open source. Llama is currently one of the best-performing open-source models

Other models:
- Llama  - Meta 
- Mistral / Mixtral - Mistral AI
- Gemini - Google
- Claude - Anthropic
- Grok - xAI

Training a large language model is extremely resource intensive; while you can train for example a simple classifier to identify if a sentence is positive or negative yourselve, this is not possible for training a LLM. For example, llama published Llama 3.1 405B; this is model that has 405 billion paramters, and that was trained on 15 trillion tokens, taking 31 million GPU hours (H100 gpus), and emmittion almost 9000 tons of CO_2 (for the training process only).

### Building a chatbot
We are now going to start working with LLM models. We will set up a chatbot ourselves and do some prompt engineering. When you provide input to an LLM, such as asking a question to ChatGPT, this is called prompting a model - you are sending a prompt to the models, which will trigger the LLM to generate an answer. We are not going to train our own LLM, but we will be using Meta's open source Llama model.

Starting Ollama
We will use ollama to run the LLM we want to use. Ollama is a platform that allows users to run various LLM locally on your own computer. This is different from for example using chatgpt, where you log in and use the online api. ChatGPT collects the input you are providing and uses this to their own benefit. Running an LLM locally using Ollama thus preserves your privacy. It also allows you to customize a model, by setting certain parameters, or even by finetuning a model.

To start ollama, you open your terminal and type:
```
ollama serve
```

Next, we will download the large language model we want to use. We are going to use the smallest open source llama model, which is llama3.1:8b. Here 3.1 is the version of the model and 8b stands for the number of paramters that the model has. 
```
!ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

Import the packages that will be used:
```python
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama
```

We can now create a model instance. Here, model defines the LLM we want to use, and temperature sets the randomness of the mode, using the value zero ensures that repeating a question will give the same model output (answer).
```
local_llm = "llama3.1:8b"
llm = ChatOllama(model=local_llm, temperature=0)
```

Now that the model is running, we can prompt it - ask it a question.
