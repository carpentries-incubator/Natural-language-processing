## Who is this lesson for?
Natural Language Processing (or NLP) refers to a set of techniques involving the application of statistical methods, 
with or without insights from linguistics, to understand natural (i.e, human) language for the sake of solving real-world tasks.

This course is designed to equip researchers in the humanities and social sciences with the foundational
skills needed to carry over text-based research projects. 

## What will we be covering in this lesson?

This lesson provides a high-level introduction to NLP with particular emphasis on applications in the humanities and the social
sciences.

After following this lessons, learners will be able to:

- Explain and differentiate what are the core topics in NLP
- Identify what kinds of tasks NLP techniques excel at, and what are their limitations
- Summarise and apply the practical, technical steps involved in preparing text (preprocessing)
- Extract vector representations of individual words, visualise it and manipulate (word embeddings)
- Solve Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT
- Summarise what other tasks are solvable with large language models
