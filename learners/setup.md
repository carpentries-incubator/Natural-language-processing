## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Installing Python

[Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and a frequent choice
for machine learning as well.
To install Python, follow the [Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) or head straight to the [download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Please set up your python environment at least a day in advance of the workshop.
If you encounter problems with the installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

## Installing the required packages

Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the package management system built into Python.
Pip should be available in your system once you installed Python successfully.
